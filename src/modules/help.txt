Modules folder will contain all connected functionality in our app
Examples if these modules are:

- Authentication Module i.e Auth
- Notifications Module
- User Management Module
- 3RD Party modules eg Sentry, Twilio etc

The main idea is to categorize the app functionality that is related to each other to 
one module.
